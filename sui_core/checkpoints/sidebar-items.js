Its primary goal is to allow for catching up to the current checkpoint sequence number of the network as quickly as possible so that a newly joined, or recovering Node can participate in a timely manner. To that end, CheckpointExecutor attempts to saturate the CPU with executor tasks (one per checkpoint), each of which handle scheduling and awaiting checkpoint transaction execution."]],"struct":[["CheckpointAggregator",""],["CheckpointBuilder",""],["CheckpointMetrics",""],["CheckpointService","This is a service used to communicate with other pieces of sui(for ex. authority)"],["CheckpointSignatureAggregator",""],["CheckpointStore",""],["CheckpointStoreConfigurator","Create config structs for configuring DBMap tables"],["CheckpointStoreReadOnly","Create an intermediate struct used to open the DBMap tables in secondary mode This is only used internally"],["LogCheckpointOutput",""],["SendCheckpointToStateSync",""],["SubmitCheckpointToConsensus",""]],"trait":[["CheckpointServiceNotify",""]],"type":[["CheckpointCommitHeight",""]]};
